### React + TypeScript + Vite

The animations are made with [Motion](https://motion.dev/):

- **Simple fade-in element**, with pulse effect while hover
- **Layout with cards**, animation between two elements using layoutId prop
- **Layout transform**, switching from full to half layout
- **Menu transition**, an animated navigation menu with toggle button
